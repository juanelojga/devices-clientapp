This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment File

Create an .env file, with the following values:

```
SASS_PATH=node_modules:src
PORT=5000
```

The project uses the port 3000 by default. The backend also uses the port 3000. For that reason it's important to set a different port number.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

First, turn on the backend project.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
